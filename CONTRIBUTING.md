# Contributing

A little check list for contributions:

 - Create an issue if you want to add a bigger feature and lets talk about it
 - Take a look at the documentation [development.md](docs/development.md)
 - Take a look at the [pull request template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
 - If you need help don't hesitate to ask questions in pull requests or issues
 - Issues you can work on are marked as "Help wantend", to be sure clarify the requirements of an issue in the comments
 
Even if your code is not perfect I would also love to see pull requests or issues with your
custom fork and implementations.

Happy coding!
